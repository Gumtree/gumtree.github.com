<h1 id="gumtree-module-4-version-control">Gumtree Module 5: Version Control</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Version control refers to keeping a track of previous or parallel versions of your work. Using version control, you can step back to previous versions, or move sideways to alternative versions. For example, you might have an experimental version of code on the instrument but want the users to stick with the well-tested version. Version control allows you to switch between them in a few seconds.</p>
<p>A further benefit of version control is that it allows multiple people to work on code without confusion. Modern version control systems (VCSs) use a 'distributed' model, where everybody has a complete copy of the entire history of the code, and the system allows smooth merging and a flow of contributions among all of the authors.</p>

<p>In the Gumtree context, it is easy to imagine a number of authors: you at the beamline making a quick bugfix; David working on your instrument code in his office; your laptop has another copy where you are playing with a new approach. Version control allows all this work to be recorded and ensures (a) that nothing is lost, and (b) that the various contributions can be assimilated and combined as necessary.</p>

<h2 id="gumtrees-version-control">Gumtree's version control</h2>
<p>Gumtree is maintained using the popular 'Git' version control system. Git repositories can be manipulated from within Gumtree (which we cover here), via the command line, or using GUI applications (e.g. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit">TortoiseGit</a> for Windows). Among many other things, Git is used to maintain the Linux kernel. <a href="http://www.git-scm.com/book">&quot;Pro Git&quot;</a> is an excellent and very readable guide to distributed version control and Git.</p>
<p>While distributed VCSs don't require a 'central' repository, for organisational purposes it can be handy. The <a href="https://github.com/Gumtree">'central' repositories for Gumtree</a> are at the publically-accessible Github website, which can be cloned at will. Each of the subdirectories in the Github Gumtree directory contains a repository for each instrument. To clone to your laptop using Gumtree see the instructions in the appendix.</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-new-branch">Creating a new branch</h3>
<p>A very worthwhile approach when working on code is to create a new branch for every feature that you add or issue that you are dealing with, so that if another conflicting issue arises you can switch between branches rather than try to work on both in the same place. So let's start by creating a new branch in our repositories: in the Git Repository perspective, expand the tree. Right-click on 'Branches' and follow the menu 'Switch To -&gt; New Branch'. Choose a branch name. The defaults for this are suitable. Click 'Finish'. At 'Branches-&gt;Local' in the Git Repositories tab (Left hand pane) you will see a new branch with your branch name on it. It will be ticked to show that the source code in the working directory corresponds to this branch. Double-clicking on another branch name will change the working directory source code to that corresponding to the branch you clicked on. Of course, we haven't changed anything compared to the code that was downloaded, so there will be no obvious effect yet.</p>

</figure>
<h3 id="changing-code">Changing code</h3>
<p>Change code using whatever editor and filesystem tools you prefer to use. For this example, I'm simply going to move our <code>monitor_button.py</code> script to the working directory. To commit this change, right-click on the top-level of the repository browsing tree (i.e. first line at the top of the left-hand pane) and choose 'Commit'. A dialog box will open up giving you an opportunity to describe what you've done, and choose which files of those that have changed you wish to include this time around. After filling in the message and choosing the appropriate files, click 'Commit' and you're done. If you do nothing else, try and commit any changes you make at the beamline, on your own branch if you prefer.</p>
<h3 id="time-travel">Time travel</h3>
<p>Right click on the top line of the repository browsing pane again and choose 'Show in -&gt; History'. At the bottom right a history pane will open up showing the progress of development on this project, as far as this particular repository knows. Each line is a Commit, with a unique label and the commit message. By right-clicking on a commit, it is possible to switch the working directory to its state immediately after that commit. Some other options including starting a branch from the chosen commit and examining the changes made by that commit.</p>
<h3 id="merging">Merging</h3>
<p>Conceptually, when we merge we are applying all the changes made in one branch back to another branch from which the first branch diverged at some stage. If we are lucky, the changes in the two branches do not overlap and the system will automatically produce files that have both sets of changes in them. If we are unlucky, there will be regions where the two files have overlapping changes ('Conflicts') and you will have to make decisions about what to do. A number of fancy text editors are available (including within the Gumtree Repository Perspective) to ease this task, but we will not cover them here.</p>

</figure>
<p>To initiate a merge from one branch to another using Gumtree, switch to the branch that you wish to merge into, then right-click and choose 'Merge'. Choose the branch that you want the changes to come from, and 'Finish'.</p>
<h3 id="synchronising-work">Synchronising work</h3>
<p>Distributed VCS means that work that you have committed is not immediately visible to everybody with a clone of the repository, but must be explicitly 'Pushed' to a repository, (or 'Pulled' from a repository depending on your point of view). To make life easier, Git has 'tracking branches', which are branches that are not supposed to be changed, but exist so that you can bring in work that has been done elsewhere without any need to resolve conflicts with your local work. After pulling from the remote repository, you can merge the remote repository's updates with your local work and then request the remote repository to 'Pull' your updated work into the appropriate branch. This will be simpler for the remote repository because your updates will be relative to a very recent point in the development of that remote repository and less likely to conflict (especially if you've done the 'Pull' - 'Merge' - 'Push' process in a few minutes).</p>
<h2 id="how-should-we-manage-our-work">How should we manage our work?</h2>
<p>Git does not prescribe any particular way of working. Given a situation where instrument scientists are making occasional bug-fixes and enhancements to the distributed Python code, and the computing team are making constant developments and improvements in parallel, how should this be managed so that both sets of work are available in a timely manner? Here are two options:</p>
<p>A: Instrument scientist commits changes to a local 'master' branch that is supposed to track the Github 'master' branch. Pros - very simple ( a single commit) and if the master branch is always in the working directory it is easy to track computer team updates. Cons - the 'master' branch on the instrument cannot be merged into the 'master' branch on Github unless the instrument version is first updated, with resolution of all conflicts, before being sent to Github. This involves potentially complex operations on unfamiliar code.</p>
<p>B: Instrument scientist commits changes to a 'beamline' branch that is tracked by Github (i.e. nobody else changes it). Pros - pushing to Github always succeeds so the work is visible; computer team can incorporate the work as availability on Github is a signal that the work is ready. Cons - beamline can only access computer team work by updating the 'master' branch, which means that bug-fixes etc. on the beamline branch are lost unless the beamline then merges the master branch changes into the beamline branch. Under this model the computer team should update the master branch on Github with the contents of the beamline branch on Github as soon as possible after changes have been pushed to the beamline branch from the instrument.</p>

<h2 id="appendix">Appendix: Downloading instrument scripts</h2>
<p>All instrument scripts are kept in <a href="https://github.com/Gumtree">publically-accessible repositories</a>. These repositories can be copied to your local instrument using Gumtree as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Open the 'Git Repository Exploring' perspective by clicking 'Git repository exploring' in the drop-down menu behind the little square multi-pane window icon with a yellow plus near the top right of your Gumtree window</p></li>
<li><p>Click on 'Clone a Git Repository'. If you already have a Git repository, this will be an icon along the top of the left-hand pane, otherwise it will be plain text</p></li>
<li><p>In the Wizard that pops up, choose 'Github' as the repository source. Click 'Next'.</p></li>
<li><p>Search for &lt;animal&gt;_scripts in the search bar at the top, or else type 'Gumtree/&lt;animal&gt;_scripts' and press return, where &lt;animal&gt; is your instrument animal. If you do not yet have any scripts, feel free to search for scripts from a similar instrument instead. If this step hangs, it is because the proxy required to get outside ANSTO has not been configured and so Gumtree cannot access the internet. One quick way to get around this is to connect wirelessly to the 'eduroam' network using your ANSTO credentials.</p></li>
<li><p>One of the search results should be 'Gumtree/&lt;animal&gt;_scripts'. Select it and click 'Next'</p></li>
<li><p>Leave the default list of branches and click 'Next'</p></li>
<li><p>Choose a local (i.e. not network) directory to hold the repository. This can be anywhere convenient for you and does not have to have any relationship to where you installed Gumtree. Leave everything else at defaults.</p></li>
<li><p>Click 'Finish'. If you navigate using your favourite file system browser to the directory from the previous step, you will find all of your instrument scripts present.</p></li>
<li><p>In order to successfully run your scripts, you will have to add the directory that they are in to the Python interpreter's <code>sys.path</code> variable as described <a href="Scripting.html#libraries">in a previous module</a>: <code>sys.path = ['/path/to/my/directory'] + sys.path</code>. This is because, while you can load the GUI script into the Gumtree GUI successfully, when the script tries to <code>import</code> files in subdirectories, it will not be able to find them unless the path to them has been explicitly set inside Python.</p></li>
