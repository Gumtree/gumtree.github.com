Exercises for Modules 1-5
=========================

Module 1: Arrays and Datasets
-----------------------------

(Arrays)

1. Create a 10x10 element array with elements in sequence from
0 to 99. Find the element in the 3rd row, 4th column.

2. Create a 10x10 element array with random elements with values
between 0 and 100.  Assume these numbers represent Poisson-distributed
counts, so var(N) = N. Set every value N for which N < 3Ïƒ to 0.

(Datasets)

3. Plot the result of exercise 2. 

4. Read in a 3-dimensional dataset from your instrument

5. Calculate the average intensity of the second frame

6. Calculate the percentage of pixels greater than the average intensity

7. Set every value in the second frame that is smaller than the average to zero and plot the result

8. Subtract the first frame from the second frame (alternatively, if you have a background dataset, subtract that)

9. Plot the estimated uncertainty of the result of the previous exercise.

Module 2: Scripting
-------------------

Exercises (choose as many as you like):

1. Adjust the [example monitor count script][moncounts] to include an option 'All'
which will display all monitor counts and automatically normalise them
if this 'All' option is chosen.

[moncounts]: monitor_counts.py

2. Write a GUI script to display the first frame of the selected file

3. Write a GUI script that sums every frame of the selected file along one direction and then plots the result

4. Write a GUI script that plots user-selectable items from the datafile (e.g. monitor counts, scan positions, temperature)

5. Write a GUI script to plot the percentage of points greater than average in each frame of the selected file

Module 4: Tips and Tricks
-------------------------

Module 5: Version Control
-------------------------

1. Create a new Gumtree branch in your previously cloned repository and add your new GUI from earlier to it

2. Commit your work

3. Switch back to the original branch and verify that your new file has gone

4. Switch back to your new branch and add an extra element to your GUI (e.g. an extra item in a selection box)

5. Run your GUI to test, then commit your work

6. Merge your work into the 'master' branch.
